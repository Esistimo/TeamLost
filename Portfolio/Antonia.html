    <p> I play a bunch of different instruments. Bass, guitar, drums, or saxophone, to name a few of them but the list goes on. On top of that I write my own songs and I used to be in a band called "Safetypins", well, we were <i>kind of</i> a band. You could say music is really important to me. It is a way to express myself and communicate my emotions to bystanders. I like every music genre, but I enjoy listening to alternativ music the most, so if I had to pick my favoutite genres, it would be Indie Rock and Pop-Punk. Punk Chick by Aaron Taos is my favourite song currently.  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5Wb2OkliDE5wqNNiAy8E4B?si=213b2d84546c48a6">Listen to it here!</a> <br>
    I love going to concerts too so here is me with the band at the last concert I went to.</p>
